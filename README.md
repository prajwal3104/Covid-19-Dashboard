# Covid-19-Dashboard

This project was focused on creating a real-time web-based dashboard for tracking the number of COVID-19 cases around the world. I utilized a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the dashboard, allowing me to gain hands-on experience with web development technologies. It took around 20 to 25 days to complete, during which I improved my skills in JavaScript. The dashboard features an intuitive and user-friendly design, with a focus on presenting the data in a clear and organized manner. Additionally, it includes a dark mode option, which has become increasingly popular in recent times and it makes the experience even more pleasing. With the help of API and data visualization i was able to deliver a real-time and accurate data which is helpful for the people to keep track of this pandemic.
